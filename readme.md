# the risley purity test

This archive contains the current branch of the Risley Purity Test.  As of 2010, it has become apparent that the purity test must become a living document, updated with current events and traditions.  We maintain an archive of old tests for posterity, as well as keeping a working document which is the current version.  

The lastest numbered version may be found at *http://rispurity.altervista.org*.
